## Type: Feature
**Features** typically represent new functionality or capabilities that add value to the end user. They are:
- User-facing enhancements
- New capabilities or modules
- Significant additions to the product
- Often larger in scope and may require multiple tasks to complete

**Example use cases:**
- "Add user authentication system"
- "Implement real-time notifications"
- "Create dashboard analytics view"

## Type: Task
**Tasks** are typically more granular work items that support features or represent specific, discrete pieces of work. They are:
- Implementation-focused activities
- Can be standalone maintenance work
- Often smaller and more focused in scope
- May be subtasks that contribute to a larger feature

**Example use cases:**
- "Update dependencies to latest versions"
- "Refactor authentication helper functions"
- "Write unit tests for dashboard component"
- "Fix styling on mobile navigation"

## Best Practices
- Use **feature** for user-visible enhancements that deliver new capabilities
- Use **task** for technical work items, subtasks, or maintenance activities
- Features can be broken down into multiple tasks
- Tasks should be completable independently and have clear acceptance criteria
